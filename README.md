# Objective

## Features

This extensions is stil a prototype in Beta version. But you can try its function

1. Type command on a HTML file: `Side Panel: browser sync`
2. Right panel will be opened with a web page enabling browser sync

# How it works

[TODO]

# Enhancement

1. Listen to more files not just `*.html`
2. Folder level setting
3. Start proxy for dynamic sites
4. Use native `browser-sync` API instead of `child_process` (I tried but I don't know why It doesn't work)
5. Use Better method to get the port number
6. Better resource management
