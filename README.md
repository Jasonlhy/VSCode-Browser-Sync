# Objective

Integrate browser sync with VSCode to provide liveload

## Features

This extensions is stil a prototype in Beta version.
But you can type command on a HTML file: `Side Panel: browser sync`, right panel will open a web page with browser sync

# How it works

[TODO]

# Enhancement

1. Listen to more files not just `*.html`
2. Folder level setting
3. Start proxy for dynamic sites
4. Use native `browser-sync` API instead of `child_process` (I tried but I don't know why It doesn't work)
5. Use Better method to get the port number
6. Better resource management
